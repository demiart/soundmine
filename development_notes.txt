Week of May 16 to May 21:
- downloaded and installed MacRuby 0.4
- compared semantic between RubyCocoa and MacRuby to determine which project was more appropriate for this project.
- read and followed the MacRuby tutorial
- watched the MacRuby screencast (1h, 20m) available at PeepCode (https://peepcode.com/products/meet-macruby).  
- XCode not working on my Mac.  It has been on the machine for some time, but will not open.  Working to fix this asap.
